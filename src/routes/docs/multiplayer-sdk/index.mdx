# Multiplayer SDK

<sl-badge variant="neutral">Draft</sl-badge>

SDK should be integrated with major WebGL based game engines and frameworks such as Babylon.js, Godot, (maybe) Unity, etc.

The first step would be to make a POC with one of open source engines, f.e. Bablyon.js.

## API design

SDK should be able to:

- Create a game session
- Join a game session
- Leave a game session
- Switch when host leaves
- Sync game session state

SDK should use matchmaking service for session creation and joining.

SDK should use WebRTC for peer-to-peer communication.

SDK should use Rollback or Lockstep for game state synchronization.

## Scripting

The API would have to take into account capabilities of the game engine and provide a way to integrate with it.

For example, in Godot, the game state is represented by a tree of nodes. The game state is synchronized by serializing the tree and sending it to other players. The tree is deserialized and applied to the game state.

Selecting a game engine and making a POC would help to understand how to integrate with it.

Host/Client separation should be taken into account. When host leaves, another client would have to become a new host and this process should be transparent to the game. Need to decide whether to use a separate host/client API or a single API with host/client separation on the SDK side and how would that work with game engine scripting.
Specifics are TBU here.
