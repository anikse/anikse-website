# Planned Components

This is a summary of ideas and notes for planned features.

## VS Code Extension

VS Code is a very advanced and extremely extendable file editor. This is supposed to be the main entry point for creator.

Extension does not intend to replace game editor (such as babylon.js or Godot), but rather to help with the final steps of the process - publishing and distribution via the web.

## Game Registry and Browser

The idea is to have a game registry and browser that allows users to browse and play games. The registry would be a simple collection of JSON files which contain lists of games and their metadata. The browser would be a simple web app that allows users to browse the registry and play games.

## Matchmaking Server

The idea is to have a matchmaking server that allows users to find other users to play with. The matchmaking server would have a simple API that allows users to find already active games and join them or register a new game instance. Server would take into account the game metadata from registry such as number of players, and other parameters.

## Multiplayer SDK

The idea is to use WebRTC and algorithms such as rollback and/or lockstep netcode to help creators easily setup networking needed for multiplayer games. The SDK should be integrated into supported game engines and frameworks such as Babylon.JS, Godot, Unity, etc. Part of process would be using matchmaking server to find other players and game registry to retrieve game metadata.
