# VS Code extension

<sl-badge variant="neutral">Draft</sl-badge>

Extension should help with the final steps of the process - publishing and distribution via the web.

Extension should be able to:

- Store: create repository in Github and upload game files
- Publish: create a new game entry in the registry (see [Games Registry](../games-registry/index.mdx))
- Run preview: run a local web server and open a preview in the browser, keeping multiplayer session possibly with other developers
- (optional) Guide: explain the process of complete game development including supported engines installation

## Storage

Extension should at first guide user to create a new repository in Github. The repository should be created in the user's account and should be named after the game. The repository should be created with a README file and, .gitignore file and potentially other metadata files needed
for the game to be published later.

## Publishing

### Include in registry

Extension should be able to request creation of a new game entry in the registry (see [Games Registry](../games-registry/index.mdx)).

Creator should be able to provide metadata for the game such as name, description, tags, etc, as Game Registry requires.

This might require use of Github API to create a new pull request in the registry repository.

### Serve from Github Pages

Extension should be able to request creation of a new Github Pages site for the game repository, or explain how to do it manually.

## Preview

Usually engines provide a way to run a local web server and open a preview in the browser.
The extension should be able to provide Matchmaking SDK with a way to keep multiplayer session with other developers.
Possibly need to look into VS Code live share extension and if possible integrate with it.
