# About Anikse

Anikse is derived from greek word `Άνοιξε`, which means 'open' or 'unlocked'.

## Motivation

Today UGC platforms become very popular and allow people to express creativity in a variety of ways.

However, most popular of them have some problems:

- **Owned by corporations** - often UGC platforms are owned by corporations, which means that they can change their policies at any time, and they can also sell your data to third parties.
- **Centralized** - most UGC platforms are centralized, which means that they can censor your content at any time, and they can also shut down their service at any time.
- **Proprietary** - UGC platforms are usually proprietary, which means that you can't use your content on other platforms, and you can't use other platforms' content on your platform. If they are closed, your content is locked in and completely inaccessible.

## Goals

Anikse intends to solve these problems by setting the following goals:

- **Decentralized** - Anikse is designed to be decentralized, which means that it can't be shut down by a single entity, and it can't be censored by a single entity.
- **Open source** - Anikse is open source, which means that you can use it for free, and you can use it on any platform.
- **Standartized** - Anikse is designed with standard APIs in mind, which means that you can use it with any UGC platform that supports these standards.
